CPTLab Thermal Studies

This is a repository for scripts that were used for data analysis and calibration fot the Thermal Studies of the BTL, summer 2019. 

Note that there are txt files in each repository giving more information about the scripts included.

## Repository Descriptions
**Calibration**
Used to calibrate the thermistors with the degrees celcius reading of the RTD.

**Resistor_studies**
During the thermal studies the SiPMs of the BTL were simulated with resistors. For the analysis of the results when the resistors were turned on there are multiple scripts. The repository also includes scripts to compare two different data sets. These scripts were used for the tests with ceramics. 

**raspberry_pi** 
Includes copies of all the scripts written to communicate with the ADC to collect data from thermistors. There are also files included that establish a connection to the MySQL database and insert the new data into it.
