## Purpose: 
- Configure ADC 
- Communicate with ADC and readout the thermistor data as well as temperatures and humidities from the enviromental sensors

## Repository Description: 
All of these are pretty much the same, they are just configured for a different number of thermistors

**thermistors_8**
- 1 ADC, 8 channels

**thermistors_16** 
- 2 ADCs, 16 channels

**thermistors_24**
- 3 ADCs, 24 channels
