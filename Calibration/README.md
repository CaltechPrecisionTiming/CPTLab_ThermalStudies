# Documentation for Calibration

## Purpose:
- Produce parameters for a calibration curve
- Calibrate thermistors with degrees celcius of rtd

## Description of included files:

**histpython.py**
input: 
- a csv data file with the steady state temperature measurements over a period of time for a specific temperature
ouput: 
- plots of histograms of the thermistor values at each temperature 
- file with each line for all thermistors being calibrated [thermistor, mean thermistor value, standard deviation]
notes:
- uses root to produce histograms



**sorted_writer.py**
input: 
- files at each tested tempertaure generated by histpython.py
output:
- files of the means values of each tempertaure, seperated by thermistor
notes: 
- this could be done in a simpler way, but it was useful to see these sorted files to get an idea of the quality of the data



**fitting_params.py**
input:
- files produced by sorted_writer.py
output: 
- file with all the fit params of the different thermistors
- outputted file also has the average fit parameters
